# Bacterifind

This project was created with the goal of increasing the efficiency of characterizing and identifying Enterobacteriaceae and other gram negative, oxidase negative bacteria.

The Enteropluri-Test is a 12 sector system, each of which contains a specific medium that changes in visual appearance after inoculation due to the specficic biochemical properties of the bacteria of interest.
